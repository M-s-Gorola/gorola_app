# GoRola — Current State (Master Index)

> **ALWAYS read this file first at the start of every session.**
> After reading this file, open the **phase file for your active phase** — it has the checklist AND the current stopping point.
> **DO NOT update this file every session.** Only update it when a phase changes status (NOT STARTED → IN PROGRESS → COMPLETE), a new env key is added, or a cross-cutting architectural decision is made.
> Per-session tracking (Last Updated, In Progress, Next Task) lives in each phase file — not here.

## 🗂️ Phase File Navigation

> **CRITICAL:** The detailed checklists live in the files below — NOT in this file.
> Open the file for your active phase and read the checklist before writing any code.

## 💡 Cross-Cutting Architectural Decisions

> **ONLY record decisions here that affect multiple phases simultaneously** (e.g. switching a shared library, changing the API envelope format, restructuring the monorepo). Phase-specific session notes belong in the phase file's own Session Notes section.

_(Append new entries here — never delete old entries.)_

**2026-05-11 — Context Split:**
- Split `current_state.md` into 4 files: this master index + `phase1_2_state.md`, `phase3_4_state.md`, `phase5_state.md`.
- Per-session tracking (Last Updated, In Progress, Next Task) moved into each phase file. `current_state.md` is now a stable reference — only update at phase boundary events.
- Phase 3 and 4 backend controllers (Service → Controller → Routes) added explicitly to every section.
- Phase 5 expanded from stub to full 6-section TDD plan. Rider frontend in `apps/web/src/pages/rider/` using `RiderRoute` guard — matching store/admin pattern.
- Discount code E2E: seed `TESTDEAL10` in Playwright `beforeAll` (Phase 3.7 adds store UI for creation).
- Weather mode E2E: use `DevWeatherToggle` (only visible in `import.meta.env.DEV`; Playwright targets Vite dev server so DEV=true).
